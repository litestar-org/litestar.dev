Organization
============

Litestar is developed by a group of volunteers and outside contributors, and lead by a
team of `Maintainers`_.

From its inception, Litestar was envisaged as a community driven project. We encourage
users to become involved with the project - feel free to open issues, chime in on
discussions, review pull requests and of course - contribute code.

Every contribution is welcome and appreciated, which is why we follow the
`All Contributors <https://allcontributors.org/>`_ guideline to recognise all of them -
Including those that don't push code.

Structure
----------

The organizational structure is very much flat, with only two distinctive roles:

- `Members <https://github.com/orgs/litestar-org/people>`_: People who have contributed
  significantly and have been granted limited administrative permissions to the Litestar
  organization
- `Maintainers`_: Long term members of the organization who have demonstrated a vested
  interest in developing and maintaining Litestar and its related projects, contributing
  significantly in administrative and development tasks


Maintainers
+++++++++++

Current maintainers of the project are:

- Cody Fincher (`@cofin <https://github.com/cofin>`_)
- Jacob Coffee (`@jacobcoffee <https://github.com/JacobCoffee>`_)
- Janek Nouvertn√© (`@provinzkraut <https://github.com/provinzkraut>`_)
- Peter Schutt (`@peterschutt <https://github.com/peterschutt>`_)
- Visakh Unnikrishnan (`@guacs <https://github.com/guacs>`_)
- Alc  (`@Alc-Alc <https://github.com/Alc-Alc>`_)

New maintainers may be nominated by any member of the Litestar organization and have to
be approved unanimously by the current maintainers.


Litestar and Starlite
---------------------

Litestar was previously named "Starlite", a name chosen as an homage to
`Starlette <https://www.starlette.io/>`_, the ASGI framework and toolkit Starlite was
initially based on. Over the course of its development, Starlite grew more independent
and relied less on Starlette, up to the point were Starlette was officially removed as
a dependency in November 2022, with the release of
`v1.39.0 <https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/releases/tag/v1.39.0>`_.

After careful considerations, it was decided that from version 2.0 onwards, Starlite
would be renamed and the name Litestar was chosen. There were many factors contributing
to this decision, but it was mainly driven by concerns from within and outside the
community about the possible confusion of the names *Starlette* and *Starlite* which
(not incidentally) bear a lot of resemblance, which now had outlived its purpose.

****

Aside from the name, Litestar 2.0 is a direct successor of Starlite 1, and the regular
release cycle will continue. It was determined that making the first release under the
new name 2.0 and continue with the version numbers from Starlite would cause the least
friction, which means the first release under the new name will be ``v2.0.0alpha3``,
following the last alpha release of Starlite,
`v2.0.0alpha2 <https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/releases/tag/v2.0.0alpha2>`_.
