Litestar Releases

Version Numbering
-----------------

Litestar follows the `Semantic Versioning standard <https://semver.org/>`_, using the ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>`` schema:

**Major**
    Backwards incompatible changes have been made

**Minor**
    Functionality was added in a backwards compatible manner

**Patch**
    Bugfixes were applied in a backwards compatible manner

Pre-release Versions
++++++++++++++++++++

Before a new major release, we will make ``alpha``, ``beta``, and release candidate (``rc``) releases, numbered as
``<major>.<minor>.<patch><release_type><number>``. For example, ``2.0.0alpha1``, ``2.0.0beta1``, ``2.0.0rc1``.

- ``alpha``
    Early developer preview. Features may not be complete and breaking changes can occur.

- ``beta``
    More stable preview release. Feature complete, no major breaking changes expected.

- ``rc``
    Release candidate. Feature freeze, only bugfixes until final release.
    Suitable for testing migration to the upcoming major release.

Long-term Support Releases (LTS)
--------------------------------

Major releases are designated as LTS releases for the life of that major release series.
These releases will receive bugfixes for a guaranteed period of time as defined in
`Supported Versions <#supported-versions>`_.

Release Cadence
---------------

Litestar aims to release a new major version every 12-18 months, with minor releases every 4-6 weeks.

.. note:: This schedule is flexible and may change based on community feedback and development progress.

Deprecation Policy
------------------

When a feature is going to be removed, a deprecation warning will be added in a **minor** release.
The feature will continue to work for all releases in that major series, and will be removed in the next major release.

For example, if a deprecation warning is added in ``1.1``, the feature will work throughout all ``1.x`` releases,
and be removed in ``2.0``.

Supported Versions
------------------

At any time, the Litestar team will actively support:

- The current major release series
- The previous major release series
- Any other designated LTS releases (Special cases)

For example, if the current release is ``2.0``, we will actively support ``2.x`` and ``1.x``.
When ``3.0`` is released, we will drop support for ``1.x``.

Bugfixes will be applied to the current major release, and selectively backported to older
supported versions based on severity and feasibility.

Release Process
---------------

Each major release cycle consists of a few phases:

#. **Planning**: Define roadmap, spec out major features. Work should begin on implementation.
#. **Development**: Active development on planned features. Ends with an alpha release and branch of ``A.B.x``
   branch from `main`.
#. **Bugfixes**: Only bugfixes, no new features. Progressively release beta, release candidates.
   Feature freeze at RC. Become more selective with backports to avoid regressions.

Business / Enterprise Support
-----------------------------

While our typical release cadence and LTS strategy is designed to support most users, we understand that some
organizations may require additional support. If you require this support we are happy to work with you on a
custom support agreement. Please contact us via our official support channels:

* `Discord <https://discord.gg/litestar>`_
